## Architecture Overview
The project consists of a scalable, data pipeline that processes, and stores data using different services and technologies.


### Key Components:
1. **Data Analysis**: Analyze data using Excel And Power Pivot.
2. **Data Pipeline (SSIS)**: Managed by SSIS To move And preprocess Into SQL Server.
3. **Data Processing (SQL Server )**:
    - First Step  Cleaning Data And Drop Unwanted Columns.
    - The second step builds Star Schema For Dimensions Tables And Fact and stores the results in SQL Server.
    - Third Step Move Data From the Sql Server To Power Bi.
4. **Data Visualization**: Processed data is displayed on Power BI for reporting.
## Technologies Used

- **Excel**: Data processing and analyzing data.
- **SSIS**: Move Data Pipline.
- **SQL Server**: Stores processed data and results.
- **Power BI**: Real-time dashboards for visualizing processed data.

### Prerequisites

- **Microsoft Excel**.
- **SSISe**.
- **SQL Server**.
- **Power BI**: Set up Power BI to visualize the data.

## Usage
- Excel: Ensure Data is Good And Make Some Analysis.
- SSIS: Use SSIS to manage and Move Data From Excel To SSIS.
- SQL Server: SQL will process the data To Make Star Schema And Dim, Fact.
- Visualize Data in Power BI: Open Power BI and ensure real-time data is visualized from SQL Server.
